- 👋 Hi, I’m @grahamgunderson
- 👀 I’m interested in Power Harvesting -- energy harvesting AT SCALE. See https://www.cleanlimitlesspower.com/ -- eternalon.com is next.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, Spice semiconductor model primitives, and how to harvest ambient energy at scale.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Modernizing FEMM with hotkeys and buffered graphics: https://github.com/cenit/FEMM, and all breakthrough energy solutions which require no fuel
- 📫 How to reach me: graham.gunderson@gmail.com
